Testing project for the UNED subject labeled as PREDA (Advanced Data Structures and Programming)

# Content
In this project I'm doint many testing on diferent data structures following the UNED's IT degree subject PREDA, which is an spanish acronym for Advanced Data Structures and Programming.

This code is to be tested in BlueJ and with learning interest only. It will never be the solution for any practical exercise from this subject

All the classes here have been coded by me while studying the subject and they may contain failures, bugs, and not very clean code so, sorry about that.
